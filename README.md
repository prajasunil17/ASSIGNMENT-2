# ASSIGNMENT-2 : Module 3: Control Structures in Python

**Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd**

For code review view / download a file named task1.py

1-First, we start with while True: which creates an infinite loop so the program keeps running until it is broken using break.

2-After that, we take input from the user.

3-We validate whether the input is an integer or not. If the input is invalid (a string or other non-integer), we print an error message.

4-We use the modulus operator `%` to check whether the number is even or odd.

5-Finally, we print the result using an if-else condition based on the check.

**Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop**

For code review view / download a file named task2.py

1- First, We create a variable with `0` value.

2- Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 50

3- Add each number to the sum using `+`

4- Finally, we display the result.
